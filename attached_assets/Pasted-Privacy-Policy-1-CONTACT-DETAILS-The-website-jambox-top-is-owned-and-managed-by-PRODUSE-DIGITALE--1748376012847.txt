3.1 Directly provided by the user
 When you subscribe to a service or complete a form, we may ask for your full name, email address, phone number, or other personal info. The more info you provide voluntarily, the better we can tailor your experience.
3.2 Server traffic report info
 When you visit our website, you reveal some information like your IP address, visit time, and referrer. Like most platforms, we log this information.
3.3 Cookies
 To personalize your experience, we use cookies to store and track your preferences. For example, we might use cookies to recognize you and deliver content tailored to your interests. Third-party advertising networks might also use cookies to adjust messages to your preferences.
 Most browsers accept cookies by default, but you can change your browser settings to notify you or refuse them. Be aware that some site sections may not display properly if you block cookies.
 Remember: when you disclose personal information online, others may collect and misuse it. While we do our best to protect your data, we cannot guarantee its security during transmission. You assume this risk when sending us any data.

5. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR DATA
We take privacy seriously. Any user traffic stats shared with third parties are aggregated and do not contain personally identifiable information.
 We will never ask for your password via unsolicited messages or calls. Always sign out and close your browser when using public networks.
 Despite our efforts, no online data transmission can be guaranteed 100% secure. You transmit data at your own risk.
 Once we receive it, we secure it per Romanian data protection standards.

6. WHO HAS ACCESS TO YOUR DATA
We may share personal information with technical service providers (e.g., for hosting, analytics, or support). These providers are contractually required to maintain confidentiality and protect your data.
 We may disclose information if legally required or to protect our rights.
 When you provide information to us, it’s shared only with Jambox unless the service is offered in partnership with another provider—those may have their own privacy policies, which we do not control.
